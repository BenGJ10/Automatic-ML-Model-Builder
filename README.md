# AutoML Studio

**AutoML Studio** is a Streamlit-based web application that automates the machine learning pipeline for supervised learning tasks (classification and regression). It allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, select and configure machine learning models, train them, evaluate performance, and visualize results interactively. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, and Plotly, this project.

## Features
- Upload and preprocess CSV datasets (e.g., splitting, scaling).
- Support for regression and classification models.
- Interactive hyperparameter tuning via a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- Performance visualization with Plotly.
- Code snippet generation for model reproducibility.
- Model saving in pickle format for deployment.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BenGJ10/AutoML-Studio.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run src/main.py`

## Project Status
Under active development... More to come!
